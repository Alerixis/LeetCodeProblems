# LeetCodeProblems
Solutions to various LeetCodeProblems that I've been solving.

I utilized Visual Studio to solve various Leet Code problems because the LeetCode web IDE is terrible unless you pay money so, I'm just going around it and figured I should save my 
solutions for posterity.

I'm going to be solving almost all of  the problems in C# because it's my primary professional language at the moment. If I do others, they'll be uploaded in separate projects denoted by language.
